"Definition 2: The number of positive versus negative attitude elements constitutes the
macrostate of an attitude."

- propositions contain information whose evaluative propoerties are context dependant though. 
- the valence of microstates cannot be determined without information from other propositions, and are therefore non-independant. 
  - e.g. "snakes maintain ecological order" relies on "ecological order is desirable"; "i run away when i see a snake" relies on "things that are avoided are generally negatively evaluated" (van dessel et al REF)
  - this model takes evaluations as its inputs, but these evaluaitons are the output in some sense
- "inconsistency of an attitude" - inconsistency can only refer to micro states; the macrostate (global evaluation) simply ranges from positive to negative, where a perfectly inconsistent microstates leads to ambivalence or neturality. 



"someone who consistently changes her attitude towards snakes would have high entropy attiutdes, where as a snak phobic person would have low entropy attudes" (imperfect quote)



"From the Proposition I.1, it follows that the natural state of an attitude is neutral or ambivalent and that consistent attitudes should be rare"

- only if the microstates are randomly determined, which is not the case



"it is our view that one of the main functions of focusing our attention on (or thinking about) an attitude object is to put such force on the attitude system and obtain (or maintain) a consistent attitude that is low in entropy."

- this would place attention at odds with inconsistency, implying that contexts in which Ss attend that their atttiudes will be consistent. 



"It is straightforward that only attitudes low in entropy fulfill the functions typically associated with attitudes, such as to organize knowledge, increase utility, and express values" 

- the function of attitudes is broadly assumed here. 



"Similarly, in attitude networks thresholds represent external information regarding the attitude object. These thresholds therefore represent the disposition of a given attitude element to be endorsed or not. A positive threshold represents a disposition of a given node to be “on” (e.g., a positive thresholds of
judging snakes as dangerous indicates that one is inclined to judge snakes as dangerous holding all other information in the attitude network constant). A negative threshold represents a disposition of a given node to be “off” (e.g., a negative threshold of judging snakes as beautiful indicates that one is inclined to judge snakes as not beautiful)"

- the attitude elements are therefore propositional if the are necessarially qualified by truth or endoresement.  



"Note that in the current article we focus on the situation in which edges between attitude elements are already present."

- this is a big qualifier

  ​

"The probability formula allows us to calculate the distribution of configurations we would expect if we measure an infinite number of individuals holding an attitude that can be described by a given Ising model."

-  why would we expect different individuals to have the same nodes?



corrispondance of the model with environmental interactions are not clear. e.g., are glauber dynamics an analogy of a mental system performing routine updating of the system, or is it intended to represent reactivity to an environmental input?



"The dependence parameter of attitude networks increases when attention is directed at attitude object, which implies that the measurement of attitudes influences the dependence parameter. Implicit measures of attitudes, such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) and the Affective Misattribution Task (AMP; Payne, Cheng, Govorun, & Stewart, 2005), limit attention directed at the attitude object by measuring attitudes without directly asking individuals to introspect."

- only the AMP argues that it limits attention directed at the attitude object; the IAT requires it
- the decreased reliability is assoicated with the measurement modality rather than the construct being measured - RT measures are generally noisier and less stable. not all implicit measures are so unstable, the amp is particularly high but is also the one that limits attention. assumptions about implciit measures seem to be incorrect. 
- even for the iat, internal consistency is relatively good. E.g., data from the atttidues 2.0 study, which included 190 different IATs, shows good internal consistency (N = 155,913, mean alpha = 0.75, SD = 0.06, mean omega_t = 0.78, SD = 0.06).
- See reliability paradox and replicable but not reliable papers



"Networks under a low dependence parameter thus show low individual temporal stability, but stable means, which precisely matches the known behavior of implicit attitude measures."

- well, they match a single property of a single measure of implicit attitudes, and cannot speak to other other measures or other properties of behaviour expressed in these measures. More importantly, this conflates the effect observed on the meaure with the attitude it is taken as a proxy of. The divergence of mean IAT effects have long been argued have a 1:1 mapping onto attiudes they seek to assess (REF). the authors model is that of representations not behaviour. This point has been overstated. 



How sensitive are all models to variation among their parameters? e.g., what range of alternative similar models were run for each simulation, and how closely to results match?



"simulation 1b: implicit measures - low behaviour prediction on individual level but high behaviour prediction on group level"

- again the authors conflate levels of analysis. Previously the model was expressed as a model of mental mechanism, where nodes represent attitude (features) and the network as a whole represents a global attitude. in this simullation, nodes represent indiviudals and the network a group. i doubt the simulations themselves, but their analogical relevance given that this analogy changes in essential ways between simulations. 
- This point is also based on a a single recent paper demontrating useful group level predictions. indiviudal level predictions within some domains (e.g., suicidality) have shown useful individual level predictions across multiple experiments (REFs).



"While researchers in this domain have long acknowledged the fact that implicit measures show low internal consistency, they have generally interpreted this as a measurement problem (e.g., Fazio & Olson, 2003; Gawronski, LeBel, & Peters, 2007; LeBel & Paunonen, 2011; Nosek & Banaji, 2011)."

- this is for good reason - becuase when you change the measurement modality the reliability increases (e.g., AMP). 



"However, the AE framework implies that the construct measrued by implicit measure is itself more internally inconsistent than the construct measured by explicit measures because the former by their very nature direct less attention twoards the attitude object than the latter"

- No, this is the premise of the framework, not the conclusion of it. These properties of effects on implicit measures were selected because of their ameniability to modelling within the framework via specifically modelling choices, some of which diverge greately from the original expression of the model (e.g, nodes as indiviudals vs nodes as attidue features in the mind), they were not predicted a priori by the model. If you try to construct a model to demonstrate X know effect and succeed in doing so, this is a success of modelling a known phenomenon with known properties rather than an explanation of those properties. 



prediction 1a reinternal consistency and stability is a broad assertion that would be predicted by many attitude frameworks, as is prediction 1b 

- prediction be can be tested with the Attitudes 2.0 data, and is shown to be correct. specificity to the model could be questioned however.



some predictions refer to testable effects (e.g., 1b) but some do not. E.g., pred 3 refers to mental representations that are not directly measureable ("Sizes of edge weights and size of attitude network predict the strength of the mere thought effect.")

prediction 3 is testable using attitudes 2.0: "attitudes are expected to be less polarized than when individuals are given more time to answer the questions" 

- extremity of gut opinions should be lower than actual opinions - evidence against (B = 0.16, p < 0.001)



"Open Question 7: In the current article we focused on single attitudes. Attitudes, however, do not exist in independence from each other and future study of the AE framework should explore whether its principles also extend to interattitudinal processes."

- attitudes are expressed in isolation - positivity towards carrots depends on the available of alternative food sources (gruel vs donuts). the current framework models only a single attitude with the global network, but not interlocking attitudes towards multiple attitude objects.  



"ultimately this might help answer the question why it is that we think: to reduce the entropy of our mental representations"

- while the analogy between mental phenomena and those in the the physcial and biological world is appealing, this is simply a reframing of existing conceptualisations of the function of thought due to coherence and consistency being appetitive.
